\chapter{Discussion} \todo*{5-15\%; outcome for a design-reader} \label{Discussion}

\todo*{combine requirements with evaluation}

\todo*{extend protocol: implement merging of results, to reduce probability of not finding computation partner; implement alternative protocols}

\todo*{implement optional verification for addition, if performance is good enough for real life application}

\todo*{computation group, implement fairness: after rejection as member of computation group either reduce backoff time or raise a priority indicator a do a weighted group}

\todo*{outlook: bt 5.0, mesh network}

\todo*{extend: combine dated data to reduce storage needs; incremental hash instead of sum}

%Based on the gamification related target group, assumptions regarding the significance of dated data can be made: for example it is of interest to compare the general average for the previous year with the personal scores, maybe also on month or week level. In contrast a more fine-grained resolution of dated data will be rarely used while requiring extensive storage, compared to summarized data.

\todo*{QoS control needed}
