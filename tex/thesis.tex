	In recent years gamification has become a part of many areas of our daily routine. In regard to our personal life, companies like Amazon or Runtastic can base their gamification approach on publicly sharing personal achievements and statistics to improve user commitment. In contrast, gamification concerning our work life has to satisfy much higher privacy demands. Since comparison is a key component for the gamification approach, privacy protecting computations of system wide statistical values (for example minimum and maximum) are needed. The solution comes in the form of \gls{SMPC}, a subfield of cryptography. Existing frameworks for \gls{SMPC} utilize the Internet Protocol, though access to the Internet or even a \gls{LAN} cannot be provided in all environments. Facilities with sensible measuring systems, e.g. medical devices in hospitals, often avoid Wi-Fi to reduce the risk of electromagnetic interference.
	To be able to utilize \gls{SMPC} in environments with Wi-Fi restrictions, this thesis studies the characteristics of \gls{MANET}s and proposes the design of a \gls{SMPC} framework for \gls{MANET}s, especially based on Bluetooth technology, and the implementation as a C library. 
	
	Since \gls{MANET}s have a high probability for network partition, a centralized architecture for the computation and data preservation is unfavorable. Therefor a distributed database based on the blockchain is implemented in the framework. Typical problems of distributed systems are addressed with the implementation of algorithms for clock synchronization and coordinator election as well as protocols for the detection of computation partners and data distribution are provided. Since the framework aims to provide distributed computations of statics for comparison, protocols for secure addition and a secure comparison are implemented, enabling the computation of minimum, maximum and average.
	
	Devices of diverse computational power will be used to verify the applicability for wearables and \gls{IoT} grade devices. Also field-tests with a \gls{SPAN}(20-50 nodes) will be conducted to evaluated real life use cases. In contrast, the security of the framework and attack scenarios will be discussed. In summary this thesis proposes a framework for \gls{SMPC} for decentralized, distributed systems.

In the last couple of years gamification has found it's way into many areas of our daily life. In regard to our personal life, companies like Amazon or Runtastic can base their gamification approach on publicly sharing personal achievements and statistics to improve user commitment. In contrast, gamification concerning our work life can have much higher privacy demands. Since comparison is a key component for the gamification approach, privacy protecting computations of system wide statistical values (for example minimum and maximum) are needed. The solution comes in the form of \gls{SMPC}, a subfield of cryptography.

Existing frameworks for \gls{SMPC} utilize the Internet protocol, though access to the Internet or even a \gls{LAN} cannot be provided in all environments. Especially many hospitals tend to avoid Wi-Fi to reduce the risk of electromagnetic interference with medical devices.

To be able to utilize \gls{SMPC} in environments with Wi-Fi restrictions, this thesis studies the characteristics of mesh-networks and proposes describes the design of a \gls{SMPC} framework for mesh-networks.
